/*When the alcohol molecules in the air meet the electrode that is between aluminum and tin dioxide,
ethanol burns into acetic acid then more current is produced. So the more alcohol molecules there are, 
the more current we will get. Because of this current change, we get the different values from the sensor.*/

/* Weakness in the design of the sensor include that moisture in breath can cause a reading by acting as a buffer between the cathode and anode. The sensor also needs a warmup period, tentatively 20 seconds
 *  after this period an initial reading is taken and compared against new readings every 3 seconds. If the reading does not change(no one breathes in) then the return should be a BAC of 0.00%. Sensitivity can be altered by the screw on the sensor.
 *  The sensor has a heater next to the measuring electrode which provides "necessary conditions" for work of the components.
